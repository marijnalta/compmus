# Computational Musicology

How did the pandemic affect the line-up of the Lowlands festival? In this portfolio, the line-up of the 2019 and 2022 edition will be compared. As a regular attendee I wondered what would have changed. I will mainly look at how the music changed. Did it become sadder? Happier? Faster? Louder?!


I expect the music to be faster, as this was the trend, partly powered by TikTok. I am curious if the sentiment also changed, if people felt more drawn to happier or sadder music. I expect happier, as the vibe at the festival was very good. There are some limitations to keep in mind. Both of the playlists contain 100 songs that the organizer feels are representative of the line-up of the festival, the songs played at the festival obviously could have been different. The playlists are a proxy for this and the conclusions drawn have limited validity.
