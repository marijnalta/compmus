# Computational Musicology

How did the pandemic affect the line-up of the Lowlands festival? In this portfolio, the line-up of the 2019 and 2022 edition will be compared. As a regular attendee I wondered what would have changed. I will look at how the music changed. Did it become sadder? Happier? Faster? Louder?!

Two main assumptions I am most interested in: 
<br>1. Music in the 2022 playlist will be faster than in the 2019 playlist, as this has been a social media trend that best can been seen on TikTok and Instagram reels.
<br>2. The sentiment has changed towards happier music, as people felt a need for positivity after lack of social contact in the pandemic years between the editions. The valence feature will be used to evaluate this.
<br><br>I will also look into danceability, energy and loudness. I expect these three features to be very similar in both playlists, as I did not feel a change in this as an attendee.
<br><br>There are some limitations to keep in mind. Both of the playlists contain 100 songs that the organizer feels are representative of the line-up of the festival, the songs played at the festival obviously could have been different. The playlists are a proxy for this and the conclusions drawn have limited validity.
